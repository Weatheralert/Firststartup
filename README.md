# My startup 
A banal application where a teenager can find a part-time job.  This is the main point.  I took this idea from personal experience when I was looking for a part-time job for the summer.  On the Internet you can find sites/applications that show employers who are looking for people for a long time.  I searched for 2 months, but never found it, I had to walk around the city and ask everyone.  So, in this application it will be possible to place advertisements only for part-time work, where the possible minimum period of part-time work and the required qualities and age will be immediately indicated.
